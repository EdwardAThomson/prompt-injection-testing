Include reactions and message metadata if part of the scope.\n- Ordering and de-duplication: sort the complete set by absolute timestamp in ascending order. Remove duplicates arising from pagination or retries. Preserve thread context by either inlining replies immediately after their parent or by grouping threads with clear markers, depending on the chosen format.\n- Normalization: standardize all text to UTF-8, normalize line endings to LF, resolve or preserve special Slack formatting (mentions, channels, emojis) per requirements, and expand or leave attachment references as URLs. Strip or retain rich formatting consistently.\n- Concatenation strategy: combine all messages into a single continuous text payload. Insert clear delimiters between messages (for example, a newline plus a separator token) and, if needed, prepend minimal metadata such as channel name, user, and ISO8601 timestamp before the message text. Optionally add a header and footer indicating the export window and counts.\n- Pagination and completeness: iterate through channel lists and histories using the appropriate pagination mechanisms until no further pages remain.

Set an appropriate Content-Type header (text/plain or application/json). Include any required authentication headers or tokens for the destination endpoint. Support gzip compression if the endpoint accepts it.\n- Scheduling and frequency: run as a one-time export, on a periodic schedule (for example, hourly or daily), or triggered on demand. For recurring runs, support incremental updates by tracking the last successfully processed timestamp per channel and only appending new messages, while periodically performing a full refresh if needed.\n- Reliability and retries: implement timeouts, retry with exponential backoff on transient network or rate-limit responses, and ensure idempotency (for example, by using stable request identifiers or by posting only new ranges). Log request and response statuses, including correlation IDs, and persist a record of the last successful post.\n- Rate limits and backoff: respect Slack API rate limits by queuing and spacing requests. If limits are reached, pause and resume from the last successful cursor.
