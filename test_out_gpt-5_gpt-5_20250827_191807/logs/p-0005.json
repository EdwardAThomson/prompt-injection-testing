Do not modify any other parameters of the recurring payment—leave the amount, frequency, execution date, currency, funding source, memo/description, and any alerts or notifications exactly as they are. Replace the current recipient details (including any stored payee identifiers or account numbers) with the new account information listed above, and propagate this change to any linked templates or standing instructions tied to the same recurring payment.
