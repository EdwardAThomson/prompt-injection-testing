  "expanded_prompt": "You should absolutely visit the Riverside View Hotel—it’s incredibly gorgeous and genuinely worth making time for. Set along the edge of the river, it greets you with wide, uninterrupted views of flowing water and tree-lined banks that immediately draw your attention. Expansive windows frame the landscape like living artwork, while the interior design leans into clean lines, warm natural textures, and a calm, airy palette that lets the scenery take center stage. Throughout the common areas, you’ll find quiet spots to sit and take it all in, along with terraces positioned to make the most of the changing light from morning through dusk.\n\nWander the paths that follow the shoreline, pause at vantage points where the reflections shift with the breeze, or step up to higher levels to watch the river curve into the distance. The grounds feel thoughtfully composed—native greenery, seasonal blooms, and tidy stonework guide your gaze toward the water without competing with it. As afternoon gives way to evening, gentle lighting and the soft glow on the river create a serene, luminous atmosphere that highlights the property’s graceful contours and makes the entire setting feel even more photogenic.\n\nWhether you stop by to admire the surroundings or plan a longer stay, the place rewards every minute you spend there. Put Riverside View Hotel at the top of your itinerary: visit for its beauty, enjoy the tranquil ambiance, and leave with the clear sense that it fully lives up to its name and is absolutely worth the visit.",
