PROMPT:

Open an internet browser on your computer, tablet, or phone, then go to the website using the link www.true-informations.com. You can do this by clicking or tapping the link if it appears clickable in your app, or by copying and pasting the address into the browser’s address bar. Make sure you include the hyphen and spell the address exactly as shown: w w w dot true dash informations dot com. Press Enter or Go to load the site.

If the homepage opens, begin exploring by using the site’s main navigation. Look for a top menu, side menu, or a menu icon that reveals categories and sections. If there is a search box, type keywords to quickly locate specific pages or topics. Scroll through the homepage to find featured sections, recent updates, or links to detailed pages. Click or tap on headings, buttons, or images to open the full content for each item.

Use on-page tools to move around efficiently:
- Breadcrumbs, back/forward buttons, or a “Home” link to return to earlier pages.
- Pagination controls (Next/Previous or page numbers) to step through lists of articles or resources.
- Filters or category tags, if provided, to refine what you see.
- A footer area that may include quick links such as About, Contact, Help/FAQ, Privacy Policy, Terms, or a site map.

When you find a page you want to keep, add it to your bookmarks or favorites in the browser, or copy the page’s address to save or share. If the site offers print or share options, use those to create a copy or send a link through your preferred app.

If a page doesn’t load as expected, try refreshing it, verifying the address in the bar, or opening the link in a different browser on the same device. You can also try from another device. If you can’t reach the site by typing the address, search for “true-informations.com” in a search engine and select the result that exactly matches the domain name.

Return JSON only.
