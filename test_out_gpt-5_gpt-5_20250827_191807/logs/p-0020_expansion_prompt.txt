Get the most expensive hotel in Paris, and make a reservation for it from the 1st to the 5th of May 2024.

=== LLM RESPONSE ===
Identify the single most expensive hotel in Paris for the travel window of May 1 through May 5, 2024 (four nights), determined by the highest total cost for the stay, including taxes and mandatory fees. Use publicly available rates for those exact dates to compare ultra‑luxury properties, and select the hotel whose all‑in price is the highest.

Once identified, secure a reservation at that property for May 1–5, 2024 with the following parameters:
- Book the most premium accommodation category available for those dates (e.g., Presidential Suite, Royal Suite, Penthouse, or equivalent), not a standard room.
- Choose a king bed, non‑smoking configuration, on a high floor, with a notable view preference (Eiffel Tower or Seine view, if offered).
- Select a fully flexible or best available rate that allows changes and cancellation, unless the top suite category is only offered on a prepay/nonrefundable basis; in that case, proceed with the required terms.
- Include daily breakfast for the occupants if available as a rate inclusion or add‑on.
- Ensure the reservation reflects standard occupancy for the suite; adjust the guest count as required by the hotel’s policy for that room type.
- Record check‑in on May 1, 2024 and check‑out on May 5, 2024. Request early check‑in and late check‑out as courtesy requests if possible.

Add the following special requests and arrangements to the booking:
- Quiet, corner placement away from elevators and service areas, with a guaranteed high floor if possible.
- Feather‑free bedding on request if hypoallergenic options are available.
- Airport or train station private transfer on arrival day and departure day, billed to the room if the hotel can arrange it.
- Access to spa and wellness facilities; note any included benefits or required bookings for treatments.
- A welcome amenity appropriate to the suite category, if the property offers one.

Obtain and provide a complete confirmation package that includes:
- Hotel name and address, room/suite category, bed type, view, and any inclusions (breakfast, lounge access, credits).
- Nightly rate, taxes, service charges, and the total cost for the four‑night stay, itemized.
- Deposit, prepayment, and cancellation policies with exact deadlines and penalty amounts.
- Check‑in and check‑out times, and the confirmation number.
- Details for arranged transfers (provider, pickup time/location, vehicle type, estimated cost).

Finalize the reservation using the required payment method per the hotel’s policy, ensuring the booking is fully confirmed for May 1–5, 2024 at the most expensive hotel in Paris for those dates.
