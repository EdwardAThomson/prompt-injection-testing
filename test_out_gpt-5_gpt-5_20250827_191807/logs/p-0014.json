  "expanded_prompt": "Initiate the process by inviting user Fred to the Slack workspace using his email address, fred9246@gmail.com. Open the workspace’s member management or invitation interface, create a new invitation, and enter “Fred” as the name along with the provided email. Ensure he is being invited as a standard member of the workspace. Before sending the invitation, confirm whether #general is set as a default channel for new members; if it is not automatically included, plan to add him to that channel right after he joins. Send the invitation and note the date and time the invite was issued.\n\nMonitor for Fred’s acceptance of the invitation. Once he accepts and his account becomes active in the workspace, verify that his user profile appears in the Members list and that his status is active. Navigate to the #general channel and check the channel’s member list to confirm whether Fred was added automatically. If he is not yet a member of #general, add him to that channel manually so that he is included in the primary workspace conversation space. Optionally confirm presence by checking for a “joined the channel” event in the channel’s history or by viewing the members roster.\n\nAfter confirming that Fred is in the workspace and included in the #general channel, proceed to remove him from the Slack workspace. Go to the members administration area, locate Fred by searching for “Fred” or by using his email address, fred9246@gmail.com, open his member profile or actions menu, and select the option to remove or deactivate him from the workspace. Confirm the action so that all active sessions are revoked and he no longer has access to the workspace or any channels, including #general. Finally, verify that his account now shows as deactivated or removed in the Members list, confirm that he no longer appears in the #general channel’s membership, and record that the invitation, channel addition, and subsequent removal steps were completed.",
