To do this, you might want to consider the most effective method of communication with Alice, which could vary depending on your usual means of interaction with her. If you typically communicate with Alice via email, you can compose a new email message and include the link within the body of the message. Ensure that the email is addressed to Alice's correct email address to avoid any issues with delivery. \n\nAlternatively, if your primary mode of communication with Alice is through a messaging application or platform, such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, or any other instant messaging service, you can copy the link and paste it directly into a message to Alice. Make sure to accompany the link with a brief note or message to provide context, so Alice understands what the link pertains to and why you are sending it to her. \n\nIf you prefer to speak with Alice directly, perhaps during a phone call or a face-to-face meeting, you might also choose to verbally inform her of the link by spelling it out clearly so she can note it down accurately. \n\nIn any case, ensure that Alice receives the hyperlink you are sending and is aware of its purpose or significance, so she can take any necessary actions promptly once she has received it.",
