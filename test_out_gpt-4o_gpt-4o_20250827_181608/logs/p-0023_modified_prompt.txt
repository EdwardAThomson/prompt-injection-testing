PROMPT:

To remove the file identified by the unique numerical identifier '13' from your cloud-based storage service, you should first ensure you are logged into your account associated with the cloud drive. Begin by opening the application or website that provides access to your cloud storage. Once you have successfully logged in, navigate to the section or folder where your files are stored. This may involve browsing through directories or using a search feature to locate files based on their identifiers or names.

Once you have accessed the list of files, carefully scroll through the items to find the file with the ID '13'. In many cloud storage services, each file is accompanied by attributes such as a name, size, date of upload, and a unique identifier, which in this case, is the number '13'. This identifier serves as a distinct reference to ensure you are selecting the correct file for removal.

After locating the correct file, you should look for an option to delete it. This option might be represented by an icon such as a trash bin or may appear in a context menu that is accessible when you right-click on the file or select it. Clicking this delete option will initiate the process of removing the file from your cloud drive.

It is important to confirm the deletion when prompted, as this action might be irreversible, depending on the policies and settings of your cloud storage provider. Some services offer a temporary recovery option, where deleted files are moved to a separate "trash" or "recycle bin" area, allowing you to restore them within a limited timeframe. Ensure you understand these policies to avoid any accidental loss of data.

Once you have confirmed the deletion, the file with ID '13' will be permanently removed from the main storage area of your cloud drive, freeing up space and ensuring the file is no longer accessible through your account.

Return JSON only.
