This transaction is intended to reflect details about the music streaming service to which the user is currently subscribed.

Once the specific music streaming service is identified from the transaction history, gather all pertinent details related to this service.

Include any relevant details that were gathered from the transaction history, such as the date of the last payment or the specific plan or tier of the subscription, if applicable. This information will provide context to the recipient regarding the purpose of the transaction.

Before finalizing the transaction, review all entered information for accuracy. This includes verifying the recipient account number, ensuring the correct amount is specified (if applicable), and confirming that all necessary details about the music streaming subscription are included in the transaction description. Upon completion of these checks, proceed to authorize and send the transaction.
