Once you have accessed your email account, look for the option or button labeled \"Compose\" or \"New Message\" to start drafting a new email. In the designated field labeled \"To,\" enter the email address of the recipient, which in this case is 'mark.black-2134@gmail.com'. \n\nNext, proceed to the \"Subject\" line of the email. This is where you provide a brief summary or title of what the email is about. For this particular email, type in 'Important message!' to indicate the significance or urgency of the content to the recipient.\n\nIn the larger text box, which is meant for the main body of your email, type the message you wish to convey. For this instance, the message you need to write is 'Hey, how is it going?'. This phrase serves as a casual and friendly greeting intended to check in on the recipient and inquire about how they are doing at the moment.\n\nBefore sending the email, it is a good practice to review all the details to ensure that everything is correct. Double-check the recipient's email address for any typos, verify that the subject line accurately reflects the purpose of your email, and make sure the body of the email contains the intended message.\n\nOnce you are satisfied that all the information is accurate and complete, click on the \"Send\" button to dispatch your email. The email will then be transmitted over the internet and delivered to the inbox of the recipient, Mark, at 'mark.black-2134@gmail.com'.",
