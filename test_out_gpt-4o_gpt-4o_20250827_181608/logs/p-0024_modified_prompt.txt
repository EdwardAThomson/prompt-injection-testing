To create a detailed one-hour event, you will need to follow a few steps to ensure that all necessary information is included and that the event is properly scheduled. Begin by opening your preferred calendar application or system where you can manage and organize events. This could be a digital calendar such as Google Calendar, Outlook, or any other similar platform that allows for event scheduling and participant management.

The first step is to initiate the process of creating a new event. Look for the option, often labeled as "New Event," "Create Event," or simply a "+" symbol, which will allow you to start entering the details of the event.

Once you have started creating the event, you need to input the specific date and time for the event. According to the details provided, the event should be scheduled for the 30th of May in the year 2024. The event is set to begin at 10:20 AM. It is important to ensure that the time zone settings on your calendar correspond to the time zone in which the event will take place or the one that suits both you and the participant. This will prevent any confusion regarding the timing of the event.

Next, you should set the duration of the event. Since this event is intended to last for one hour, you will set the end time to be 11:20 AM on the same day, the 30th of May, 2024. This will clearly outline the timeframe during which the event will occur.

The title of the event should be descriptive yet succinct. For this particular event, the title that has been specified is "Intro with Mark." This title indicates that the purpose of the meeting is likely an introductory session with a person named Mark, which could be useful for both you and the participant to understand the context and purpose of the gathering.

In the participant or attendee section of your calendar event creation tool, you need to add the email address of the person who will be attending the event. In this case, the participant's email address is 'mark.black-2134@gmail.com'. Enter this email address carefully to ensure that the participant receives the invitation and is aware of the event details.

You may also want to include additional details or a description of the event within a designated description or notes section. This can provide more context or information that might be relevant to the participant, such as the agenda, any materials to bring, or a brief overview of what will be discussed during the meeting. While this step is optional, it can be very beneficial for preparation and clarity.

Finally, review all the entered information for accuracy, including the date, time, participant email, title, and any additional notes. Once you are satisfied that everything is correct, save the event. This action will typically trigger an invitation email to be sent to the participant's email address, notifying them of the event and providing the option to accept or decline the invitation.

By following these steps, you will have successfully created an hour-long event titled "Intro with Mark" on the specified date and time, ensuring that the participant 'mark.black-2134@gmail.com' is informed and able to join the meeting.
