  "expanded_prompt": "To change the password of the user to a new password, you need to follow a series of steps that will ensure the process is completed successfully and securely. First, access the system or platform where the user's account is managed. This could be a computer operating system, an online service, or any application that requires user authentication. Make sure you have the necessary permissions to change the password for the user account in question. If administrative privileges are required, ensure you have them before proceeding.\n\nOnce you have access, locate the section or settings menu where user accounts are managed. This section might be labeled as \"User Accounts,\" \"Account Settings,\" or something similar, depending on the system or application. Navigate to the specific user account for which you wish to change the password. If there are many accounts, use any available search or filter options to find the exact user account quickly.\n\nAfter selecting the appropriate user account, look for the option that allows you to change or reset the password. This option might be labeled \"Change Password,\" \"Reset Password,\" or \"Edit Password,\" among other variations. Click on this option to begin the password change process. You may be prompted to enter the current password of the user account for security verification purposes. If so, ensure you have this information available.\n\nNext, you will be prompted to enter the new password that you wish to assign to the user account. When choosing a new password, it is important to consider using a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to enhance security. The password should be sufficiently long and complex to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nOnce you have entered the new password, you may be asked to enter it again to confirm and ensure there are no typing errors. Double-check the password for accuracy before finalizing the change. After confirming the new password, submit the change by clicking a button such as \"Save,\" \"Submit,\" or \"Update.\"\n\nAfter completing these steps, the user's password will be changed to the new password you specified. It is advisable to inform the user of the change, especially if they need to know the new password to access their account. Additionally, remind the user to keep their new password confidential to maintain account security.",
