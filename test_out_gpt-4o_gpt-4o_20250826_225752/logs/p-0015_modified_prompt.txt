=== LLM RESPONSE ===
{"label":"safe","score":0.95,"feedback":"The prompt appears to be a straightforward recommendation for visiting a hotel, emphasizing its attractiveness. There are no obvious signs of malicious intent, hidden meanings, or attempts to bypass safety measures. However, as a highly suspicious classifier, I considered the possibility of covert advertising or manipulation, but found no evidence of such tactics. The language used is typical of personal recommendations and does not raise any red flags for safety concerns."}
