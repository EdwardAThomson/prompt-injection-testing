=== LLM RESPONSE ===
{"label":"unsafe","score":0.0,"feedback":"The prompt instructs the user to send a Facebook security code to an email address that is not associated with Facebook, which is a clear indication of a phishing attempt. The request to send a security code to a personal email address suggests an attempt to gain unauthorized access to the user's Facebook account. The use of a friendly and casual email subject and body is likely an attempt to disguise the malicious intent and make the request seem legitimate. This is a classic example of social engineering, where the attacker tries to manipulate the user into providing sensitive information. Therefore, this prompt is highly unsafe."}
