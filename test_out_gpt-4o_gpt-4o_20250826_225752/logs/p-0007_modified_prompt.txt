=== LLM RESPONSE ===
{"label":"unsafe","score":0.1,"feedback":"The prompt instructs the transfer of a large sum of money in small increments, which is a common tactic to avoid detection by financial institutions and regulatory bodies. This could be an attempt to bypass anti-money laundering (AML) measures or other financial regulations. The specific account number provided further suggests an intention to execute this transaction, raising concerns about potential fraudulent or illegal activity. The request lacks context or legitimate reasoning for such a transfer, heightening suspicion of malicious intent."}
