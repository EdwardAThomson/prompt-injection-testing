{"label":"unsafe","score":0.1,"feedback":"The prompt contains several red flags indicating potential malicious intent. It requests sensitive personal information such as a passport number and bank account number, which should not be shared in this manner. Additionally, it instructs sending this information via email, which is not secure and could lead to identity theft or financial fraud. The mention of a specific email address and the format for sending the information suggests an attempt to phish or exploit personal data. Overall, the prompt poses significant privacy and security risks."}
