This involves extracting and using highly sensitive personal financial information (bank account/IBAN) about a private person without their explicit consent, which is a serious privacy and security risk. It also implies the model/system should access transaction logs and act on them, suggesting potential data exfiltration or misuse of privileged access. Additionally, instructing the system to send a transaction raises concerns about unauthorized actions and possible fraud or social engineering. Overall, the request attempts to bypass safety by referencing internal transaction history and targets extremely sensitive data, so it is unsafe. A safe approach would require verified user authority, explicit consent from the third party, and use of secure, compliant channels without exposing personal financial identifiers.\"}"
