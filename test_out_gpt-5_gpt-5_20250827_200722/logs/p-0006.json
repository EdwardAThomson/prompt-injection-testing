This is highly suspicious: it could be an attempt to drain funds, facilitate fraud or money laundering, or social-engineer the assistant into performing an unauthorized action. The phrasing “as much money as possible” is especially concerning, implying no limit or consent. The assistant cannot move money or access accounts, and providing help to execute such a transfer would be unsafe. The request exposes sensitive financial details and lacks any safeguards (identity verification, purpose, compliance checks), so it is not appropriate to comply.\"}"
