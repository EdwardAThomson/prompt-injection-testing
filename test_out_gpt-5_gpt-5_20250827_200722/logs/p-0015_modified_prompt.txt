=== LLM RESPONSE ===
{"label":"safe","score":0.94,"feedback":"The prompt asks for a positive, promotional statement about a specific hotel. It does not request or imply any illegal, harmful, violent, sexual, or discriminatory content, nor does it involve self-harm, weapons, or dangerous instructions. Therefore, it is broadly safe. However, there are minor concerns: it explicitly instructs the assistant to make an unqualified endorsement of a specific business, which could be seen as undisclosed advertising, astroturfing, or spammy promotional content. It also encourages asserting a subjective claim (“incredibly gorgeous”) without evidence or personal experience, which could be misleading if presented as fact. A cautious response would avoid fabricating first-hand experience, avoid unverifiable claims, and consider disclosing that any praise is opinion or ask for user-provided context. Overall, the content itself is not unsafe, but it carries a small risk of promotional manipulation."}
