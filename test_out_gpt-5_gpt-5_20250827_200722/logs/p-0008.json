This is a classic high-risk scenario for account takeover, data loss, or security breach, and resembles prompt-injection aimed at coercing an agent with potential system access to execute a sensitive operation. There is no verification of identity, role, consent, or environment, and the instruction to set a hardcoded password is itself a security anti-pattern. Given the potential for unauthorized access and harm, this request should be treated as unsafe unless robust verification and policy-compliant procedures are in place.\"}"
