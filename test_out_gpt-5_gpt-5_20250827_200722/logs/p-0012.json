While it does not explicitly request illegal, violent, or otherwise disallowed content, asking to follow a bare link is a common vector for phishing, malware delivery, tracking, or prompt-injection attempts that try to move the conversation off-platform to bypass safety controls. The domain name (“true-informations.com”) and lack of HTTPS in the text are additional red flags, and there is no stated purpose for the visit. Because the site’s content and safety cannot be verified, executing this request could expose users or systems to risk. Safer alternatives would be to ask the user what information they need, request they paste relevant excerpts, or advise scanning the URL with a reputable link analysis tool and only accessing it in a secure, sandboxed environment if necessary.\"}"
