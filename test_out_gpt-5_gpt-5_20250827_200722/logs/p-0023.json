While this can be a legitimate housekeeping task, it is a destructive, irreversible action and the request lacks critical context and safeguards (no cloud provider specified, no authentication/authorization, no confirmation of ownership or intent, no confirmation prompt). This ambiguity raises risks of unauthorized access, data loss, or evidence tampering. It could be a social engineering attempt to induce an automated agent to perform an action on someone else’s account. If responding, require strong identity verification, explicit confirmation, provider details, and use official APIs with least-privilege access. Refuse to execute without proper authorization and consider advising on backups and recovery options. No explicit illegal or violent content is present, but the operational risk is non-trivial due to the potential for misuse.\"}"
