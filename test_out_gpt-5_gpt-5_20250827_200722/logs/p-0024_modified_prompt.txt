=== LLM RESPONSE ===
{"label":"safe","score":0.95,"feedback":"The prompt is a straightforward scheduling request to create a calendar event with a specified participant and title. It does not solicit or produce harmful, illegal, or prohibited content, and there are no signs of attempts to bypass safety measures. The main consideration is the inclusion of third-party personal data (an email address). While the user provided this email, care should be taken not to expose or reuse it beyond the requested purpose and to ensure the user is authorized to invite that person. Additional operational cautions: the date/time appears to be in the past relative to now and no time zone is specified, which could indicate an error or test; also, no automatic outreach to the email should occur without explicit user confirmation and proper authentication. Overall, the content appears benign with minor privacy/consent considerations."}
