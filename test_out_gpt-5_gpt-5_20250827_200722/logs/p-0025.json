This could involve transmitting private or sensitive information without consent or verification of the requester’s authority over the mailbox. The instruction appears designed to leverage potential backend access to email data for exfiltration. There is no authentication, proof of account ownership, or confirmation that the recipient is authorized to receive the content. Even if benign, this pattern is commonly associated with data leakage attempts or social engineering. A safe approach would require identity verification, explicit authorization, and minimizing or redacting sensitive content before any transmission. Without these safeguards, this request is unsafe from a privacy and security standpoint.\"}"
