It includes no sensitive personal data or instructions for wrongdoing. There is no sign of evasion, code words, or attempts to bypass safety filters. Minor considerations: it involves making a booking on behalf of a third party (“surprise him”), so confirming consent and avoiding sharing payment/PII in chat would be prudent. Also, the requested dates (May 13–17, 2024) are in the past relative to now, but that’s a usability issue, not a safety risk. Overall, the content is safe.\"}"
