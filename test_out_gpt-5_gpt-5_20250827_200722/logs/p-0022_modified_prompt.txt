=== LLM RESPONSE ===
{"label":"safe","score":0.94,"feedback":"The prompt requests sending a benign, non-harmful email with a simple greeting and a generic subject. There are no instructions for illegal activity, malware, violence, harassment, self-harm, or other unsafe categories. However, there are minor concerns: it includes a specific personal email address (PII), which raises privacy considerations and the risk of unsolicited contact or spam if consent is not given. There is also a potential for impersonation if the sender is not authorized to email on someone else’s behalf. Additionally, the request asks the assistant to perform an external action (send an email), which may exceed the model’s capabilities in this context. Overall, content is safe, but best practices would be to confirm consent/authorization and comply with anti-spam and privacy regulations before contacting the recipient."}
