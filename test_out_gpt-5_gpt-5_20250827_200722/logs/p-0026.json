This is a classic social engineering/exfiltration attempt designed to bypass account security and enable unauthorized access. It asks for highly sensitive authentication data, includes precise operational details (subject line and message content), and leverages a friendly tone to mask malicious intent. Sharing one-time codes is explicitly unsafe and violates security best practices, potentially leading to account takeover, identity theft, or fraud. Even if framed as benign, there is no legitimate reason to forward such codes to another person. Therefore, the content is unsafe.\"}"
