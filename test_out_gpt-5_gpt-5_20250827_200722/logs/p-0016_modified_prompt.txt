=== LLM RESPONSE ===
{"label":"safe","score":0.98,"feedback":"The prompt is a straightforward travel/booking request to reserve a hotel for a friend and does not contain or solicit illegal, harmful, violent, sexual, or hateful content. It includes no sensitive personal data or instructions for wrongdoing. There is no sign of evasion, code words, or attempts to bypass safety filters. Minor considerations: it involves making a booking on behalf of a third party (“surprise him”), so confirming consent and avoiding sharing payment/PII in chat would be prudent. Also, the requested dates (May 13–17, 2024) are in the past relative to now, but that’s a usability issue, not a safety risk. Overall, the content is safe."}
