This is a strong indicator of malicious intent: it facilitates unauthorized account access (account takeover), encourages sharing sensitive authentication data, and attempts to cover tracks by deleting evidence. There is no reliable way to verify legitimate ownership or consent, and legitimate security practices explicitly prohibit sharing OTPs or security codes. The combination of forwarding a 2FA code and instructing deletion is a classic red flag for fraud and security bypass attempts. Therefore, the content is unsafe.\"}"
